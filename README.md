## Introduction

In software development, consistency is key. Following a set of coding standards helps ensure that everyone on the team writes code in a similar manner. This leads to better readability and maintainability. The **Code Style Guidelines** repository is designed to help you adopt best practices in your coding journey.

For detailed information and updates, please visit our [Releases section](https://github.com/Bluehead80/code-style-guidelines/releases).

## Languages Covered

This repository includes guidelines for the following programming languages:

- C++
- C#
- Dart
- Flutter
- Java
- JavaScript
- Kotlin
- PHP
- Python
- Ruby
- Rust
- TypeScript

## Getting Started

To get started with our coding standards, clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Bluehead80/code-style-guidelines.git
```

Once you have cloned the repository, navigate to the directory:

```bash
cd code-style-guidelines
```

Here, you will find folders and files dedicated to each language. Review the specific guidelines for the language you are working with.

## Guidelines

### General Principles

1. **Readability**: Code should be easy to read and understand. Use meaningful names for variables, functions, and classes.
2. **Consistency**: Follow the same style throughout the codebase. Use the same naming conventions and formatting.
3. **Documentation**: Comment your code where necessary. Use docstrings for functions and classes to explain their purpose.
4. **Version Control**: Use Git for version control. Make clear and concise commit messages.

### Language-Specific Guidelines

#### C++

- Use `camelCase` for variable names and `PascalCase` for class names.
- Indent with spaces, not tabs. Use four spaces per indentation level.
- Place `#include` directives at the top of the file.

#### C#

- Follow the .NET naming conventions. Use `PascalCase` for public members and `camelCase` for private members.
- Use XML documentation comments for public methods and classes.
- Keep lines of code to a maximum of 120 characters.

#### Dart

- Use `lowerCamelCase` for variable and function names.
- Prefer `const` and `final` for variables when applicable.
- Organize imports into three sections: Dart SDK, third-party packages, and local files.

#### Flutter

- Use `Widgets` to build the UI. Keep the business logic separate.
- Follow the `Material Design` guidelines for consistency.
- Utilize `StatelessWidget` and `StatefulWidget` appropriately.

#### Java

- Use `camelCase` for variable and method names, and `PascalCase` for class names.
- Use Javadoc comments for public methods and classes.
- Follow the `Java Code Conventions` for formatting.

#### JavaScript

- Use `camelCase` for variable names and `PascalCase` for classes.
- Use `const` and `let` instead of `var` for variable declarations.
- Follow `ESLint` rules for consistent code style.

#### Kotlin

- Use `camelCase` for variable and function names.
- Use `PascalCase` for class names.
- Utilize `data classes` for simple data holding.

#### PHP

- Use `camelCase` for variable names and `PascalCase` for class names.
- Follow the `PSR-1` and `PSR-2` standards for coding style.
- Use `PHPDoc` for documentation.

#### Python

- Follow the `PEP 8` style guide for Python code.
- Use `snake_case` for variable and function names.
- Keep lines to a maximum of 79 characters.

#### Ruby

- Use `snake_case` for method and variable names.
- Use `PascalCase` for class names.
- Follow the `Ruby Style Guide` for formatting.

#### Rust

- Use `snake_case` for variable and function names.
- Use `CamelCase` for struct and enum names.
- Follow the `Rust Style Guide` for best practices.

#### TypeScript

- Use `camelCase` for variable names and `PascalCase` for class names.
- Utilize interfaces for type definitions.
- Keep code clean and maintainable by following `TypeScript` best practices.

## Testing Standards

Testing is crucial for ensuring code quality. Follow these standards:

1. Write unit tests for all functions and classes.
2. Use a testing framework appropriate for your language (e.g., `JUnit` for Java, `pytest` for Python).
3. Aim for at least 80% code coverage.

## CI/CD Practices

Implementing Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) helps automate the development process. Follow these practices:

1. Use a CI/CD tool (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins) to automate builds and tests.
2. Run tests on every pull request to ensure code quality.
3. Deploy to production only after passing all tests.
